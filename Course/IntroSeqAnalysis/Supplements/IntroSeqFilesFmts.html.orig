<h2><a name="seq"></a>Sequences and Sequence Formats</h2>
<p> Sequences are ubiquitous in molecular biology and bioinformatics.
Linear strings of characters (sequences) are used to represent
biological macromolecules that are built as long linear chains of
chemical components.  There are two main categories of macromolecules
typically represented in this manner: nucleic acid and protein.
Nucleic acids are further subdivided into DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)
and RNA (ribonucleic acid).  Nucleic acids and proteins are the
fundamental building blocks of living systems.  While it is common for
biological macromolecules and their corresponding sequences to be
considered interchangeably, the abstraction involved in representing
macromolecules in terms of character strings is not a trivial one.  It
is important to keep this in mind when working with sequences.

<p>In order to appreciate this abstraction, one must have at least a
basic understanding of the concepts of molecular biology.  It is beyond
the scope of this document to introduce the field of molecular biology.
A complete introduction can be found in any modern textbook on
biochemistry or molecular biology.  Also, see the <a
href="/biomed505/IntroSeqAnalysis/Supplements/MolGenPrimer.pdf"><i>Primer
on Molecular Genetics</i></a> (also included in this course handbook).

<p>For basically historical reasons, there are a number of different
sequence formats, and sequences commonly exist in a variety of formats.
Some of the more widely used formats are: FASTA, Genbank, EMBL and
SWISS-PROT.  Most formats are named after the sequence analysis software
or the sequence database for which they were developed.  If your
sequence is not in a recognized standard format, you will not be able to
easily analyze your sequence.  This can be very confusing for the
uninitiated.  Certain analysis software requires sequences to be in a
particular format, while other software (e.g. EMBOSS) aims to make life
easier by automatically recognizing many different formats.  It is,
however, an unfortunate fact of life that one of the tasks with which
you will first need to become familiar is converting sequences between
different formats that hold more-or-less the same information.

<p>Sequence formats are <b>ASCII text</b>.  When we talk about a
'sequence format' we are NOT talking about any sort of program-specific
format like word processor formatting or a text formatting language.  We
are not talking about things like: NOTEPAD, WORD, WORDPAD, PostScript,
PDF, RTF, TeX, HTML, XML, or anything else of that ilk.  Basically this
means you should not use word processors to write sequences.  If you do,
make sure you save the file as ASCII text.

<p>Sequences are represented using "alphabets" of characters (the <a
href="http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naseq.html#500">IUPAC
standard one-letter codes</a>) that in turn represent the components of
which the corresponding macromolecules are made up.  In the case of
nucleic acids, the components are the so-called nucleotides.  The
nucleotide codes are summarized in <a href="#ntcodes">Table 1</a>.
Proteins are made up of 20 different amino acids, which are similarly
denoted by 20 different single-letter codes.  The amino acid codes are
summarized in <a href="#aacodes">Table 2</a>.  In both cases, redundancy
codes also exist to represent two or more of the individual codes.

<p> A typical way of storing and working with sequences on a computer is
in text files, and another of the first tasks with which you will need
to become familiar is the viewing and editing of sequence files.

<h2><a name="ids">Sequence IDs and Accession Numbers</a></h2>
At a minimum, all sequence formats contain the sequence itself.  A
sequence does not require any sort of identification.  However, it is
certainly useful!  Most sequence formats contain an identifier (name,
accession number, etc.) somewhere near the beginning of the sequence
format.

<p>An entry in a database must have some way of being uniquely
identified in that database.  Most sequence databases have two such
identifiers for each sequence: an ID and an Accession Number.  Why two
identifiers?  Again, the reasons are mostly historical.  IDs were
originally intended to be a human-readable name that gave some
indication of the origin and function of the sequence.  In EMBL and
GenBank the first two or three letters indicated the species and the
rest indicated the function.  So for example, 'HUMHBB' would be the
'Human hemoglobin beta gene'.  Such a naming scheme became impractical
once huge numbers of sequences -- many with unknown function -- began to
be submitted to the databases every day.  Accession numbers began to be
used as the ID as well.  Therefore you will now find IDs like
'AF061303', the same as the Accession number for that sequence in EMBL.

<p>IDs are not guaranteed to remain the same between different versions
of a database (although in practice they usually do).  Accession numbers
are unique alphanumeric identifiers that are guaranteed to remain with
that sequence through the rest of the life of the database.  If two
sequences are merged into one, then the new sequence will get a new
accession number and the accession numbers of the merged sequences will
be retained as 'secondary' Accession numbers.  GenBank, EMBL and
SwissProt share an accession numbering scheme whereby an accession
number uniquely identifies a sequence within these three databases.

<h2><a name="annot">Sequence Annotations</a></h2>
Most sequence formats allow additional information such as a description
or comments to be associated with a sequence.  Some formats have
additional fields for holding information such as references, keywords,
associated database entries, cross-references in other databases and
feature tables.  Such information is often referred to generically as
annotations.

<h2><a name="feat">Sequence Features and Feature Tables</a></h2>
A feature is a region of interest on a particular nucleic acid or
protein sequence.  Features have a specified start and end position and
have a name describing what type of thing it is.  Features may also hold
many other pieces of information such as: the strand (nucleic acid), the
name of the analysis program or database that from which they were
derived, etc.

<p>Feature Tables are groups of features.

<p>As with sequences themselves, there are different formats for
representing features.  As a result of the fact that the majority of
sequence analysis programs find regions of interest in an input
sequence, the number of feature formats is vast and chaotic.  They range
from graphical displays of where restriction enzymes cut, to
probabilities of the three states of a protein secondary structure
prediction along a sequence, to rigidly defined text tables of the start
and end positions of things like predicted exons or motif matches.  A
review of all such formats is clearly beyond the scope of this document.
Instead, only the well-defined feature formats that have been developed
for the major sequence databases (EMBL, Genbank, SwissProt) and for
the input of features into the genome databases (GFF) will be mentioned.

<p>Feature tables can either be stored as part of a sequence file or
database entry, or they can be stored in a file that does not contain
the sequence that to which the features refer.  The latter is called a
raw feature table.  When feature tables are held together with the
sequence to which they refer, then the feature format is the same as the
sequence format (e.g. The GenBank feature table format is part of the 
GenBank sequence format).

<p>Most feature table definitions have a controlled vocabulary.  This
means there is a specified list of feature key names and only names in
this list may be used.  Thus, you cannot edit feature tables in a
prarticular format to add in features with arbitrary names.  If you edit
the feature tables, you must stick to the allowed set of feature Keys.
Table 3 contains links to the common feature table definitions.

<h2><a name="fasta"></a>A Detailed Description of FASTA Format</h2>
FASTA format is widely used and most sequence analysis software will
accept sequences in FASTA format.  This section describes in detail the
structure and organization of the FASTA format.

<p>A sequence in FASTA format consists of three parts:
<ul>
  <li>A greater than symbol `&gt;' at the beginning of a line.</li>
  <li>A single line title.  Within the title line, a string of non-whitespace characters immediately following the greater than symbol `&gt;' is the sequence ID (name, accession number), and the rest of the description line is the sequence description.  The ID and the description are both optional.</li>
  <li>he sequence itself, containing possible newlines and continuing until end of file or the next greater than symbol `&gt;' at the beginning of a line is reached.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that all lines of text be shorter than 80
characters in length.  The following example contains two sequences in
FASTA format:
