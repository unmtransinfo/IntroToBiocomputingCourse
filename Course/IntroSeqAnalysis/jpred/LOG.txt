--Checking number of sequences
5716 sequences were found in the alignment, this is too many for us too handle sensibly. So I'm going to reduce this to 1000 sequences by taking every 5th sequence.

Finding which sequences to keep at the 75 % level
From the original set of 1143 sequences, 936 are
non-redundant with 794 unclusterd entities...
And 944 of the orignal set are included for further analysis, this may
total more than the non-redundant set due to repeats in sequence IDs.
