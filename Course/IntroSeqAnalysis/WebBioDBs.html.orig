<strong>Abstract:</strong> These exercises are designed to familiarize you with some of the issues and concepts involved with retrieving biological data from online databases.  We will focus on ENTREZ, a data retrieval system developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which is probably the most widely used system for such purposes.  ENTREZ provides integrated access to a wide range of data domains including biomedical literature, chromosomes, genetic loci, nucleotide and protein sequences, three-dimensional structures, and more.  In doing so, ENTREZ leverages the many logical relationships that exist between individual entries in the various NCBI databases.  The best way to grasp these relationships is by using the system.  As you work through this section, you may find it helpful to consult the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/helpdoc.html">ENTREZ help document</a>.
<br>
<br>
Questions you should answer as you work through the exercises are indicated by <span class="class2"><a href="">Question:</a></span> tags, which also serve as hyperlinks to the corresponding answers (where available).

        <li><span class="input">16S RNA</span></li>
        <li><span class="input">"16S RNA"</span></li>
      </ul>
      Which search retrieves fewer documents?  One thing to note is that using quotes causes ENTREZ to check the search phrase (the text within the quotes) against a phrase list.  If the search phrase is not in the phrase list, the ENTREZ treats the terms as though they are not in quotes.

Entrez automatically truncates on the author's name to account for various initials and designations, such as Jr. or 2nd. If only a last name is used in the query box (e.g., jefferson), ENTREZ will search All Fields for that term.  Go back to the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/">ENTREZ search page</a> and compare the results obtained by searching with the following different expressions:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="input">baltimore</span></li>

    <td class="step">4. Boolean operators</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The ENTREZ search engine allows search terms to be combined using any of the following boolean operators:<br>
       &nbsp; <strong>AND:</strong> Combining two search terms with AND instructs ENTREZ to find all documents that contain BOTH terms.<br>
       &nbsp; <strong>OR:</strong> Combining two search terms with OR instructs ENTREZ to find all documents that contain EITHER term.<br>
       &nbsp; <strong>NOT:</strong> Combining two search terms with NOT instructs ENTREZ to find all documents that contain search term 1 BUT NOT search term 2.
      <p>The ENTREZ search rules and syntax for using Boolean operators are:<br>
       &nbsp; 1. Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT must be entered in UPPERCASE (e.g., promoters OR response elements).<br>
       &nbsp; 2. ENTREZ processes all Boolean operators in a left-to-right sequence. The order in which ENTREZ processes a search statement can be changed by enclosing individual concepts in parentheses. The terms inside the parentheses are processed first as a unit and then incorporated into the overall strategy. For example, the search statement: g1p3 AND (response element OR promoter) is processed by Entrez by ORing the terms response element OR promoter first and then ANDing the resulting set of documents with g1p3.<br>

  <tr>
    <td class="step">5. Writing advanced queries</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Complex search statements can be written and executed directly from the the query box of the cross database search page, or on any of the individual ENTREZ database pages (e.g. Nucleotides, Proteins, PubMed. etc), as long as you obey some simple rules and use the correct syntax.  One of the most powerful techniques you can utilize in writing queries is to restrict searches to particular database fields.  Searches can also be refined by using the Limit, Preview/Index, and History options on the ENTREZ search pages.  The key to using these options, especially the Limit and Preview/Index options, is to have a good understanding of the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/Summary_Matrices.html" >search fields</a> of the ENTREZ databases.
      <p>Limits can be applied to restrict ENTREZ searches to particular database fields.  This can be very helpful in refining searches to retrieve only the most relevant documents.  In order to apply limits, a field qualifier is used after the search term.  The format is as follows:
      <br> &nbsp; <strong>term[qualifier] operator term[qualifier] ...</strong>
      <br>where operator is any of the boolean operators covered in step 4 and [qualifier] is one of the field qualifier summarized in the table below.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/Summary_Matrices.html">Click here for a full list of ENTREZ search field qualifiers.</a>
