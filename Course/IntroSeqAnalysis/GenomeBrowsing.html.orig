<div class="text">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> This section of the "Introduction to Sequence Analysis" is designed to familiarize you with some of the issues and concepts involved with browsing and retrieving genomic data from online genome databases.  There are three main public online genome browsing sites: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/">The NCBI Map Viewer</a>, <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a> and <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">The UCSC Genome Browser</a>.  Each of these sites host data for a large collection of genomes.  The background reading article: "A User's Guide to the Human Genome, Question 1." (<em>Nature Genetics,</em> vol. 32 supplement: 9-17 (2002) <a href="/biomed505/Course/IntroSeqAnalysis/Supplements/HumanGenomeUsersGuide.pdf"><img src="/images/pdf.gif" height="16" width="16" border="0" alt="PDF"></a>) will provide a brief introduction to each of these.
      <p>For this set of exercises, we are going to focus on the use of <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a>, and work through some examples showing how to access human genomic information.  You should take the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Docs/enstour/index.html">guided tour of Ensembl</a> before starting these exercises.
<br>
<br>
Questions you should answer as you work through the exercises are indicated by <span class="class2"><a href="">Question:</a></span> tags, which also serve as hyperlinks to the corresponding answers (where available).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Typographical conventions:</strong> <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Regular web links look <a href="">like this</a><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Input that you should enter verbatim in web page forms, or links/buttons you should click on web pages look <span class="input">like this</span><br>

    <td>At the very top of this page is a query form with which you can do multi-species text searching.  Below this, there is 'About Ensembl' plus links to general help and documentation.  Also on this page are links to the various species-specific browsers.  Ensembl works in virtually the same way, regardless of the organism, so don't worry if your main species of interest is not human.  After completing these exercises, you will be much better able to to navigate your genome of interest using Ensembl.
      <p>Click on the <span class="input">Human</span> button.  Then, in the "Browse a Chromosome" section, click on chromosome <span class="input">20</span>.  This will take you to the Ensembl MapView page for chromosome 20.

    <td>The Ensembl ContigView is the principal data visualization tool for genome sequence annotation information.  It provides a high level view of the contig sequences that form the human genome sequence assembly, and of the genes and other features that have been placed on it.  The page is split into four sections representing different levels of zooming into the chromosome:
      <dl>
        <dt>Chromosome Panel
        <dd>The Chromosome panel displays an ideogram of an entire chromosome with its cytogenetic banding pattern (or alternative sequence block for species with no chromosome assemblies).<br><img src="/biomed505/Course/IntroSeqAnalysis/images/chromosome.png" border="0" alt="Ensembl ContigViewChr"></a><br>
        <dt>Overview Panel
        <dd>The Overview panel displays a larger section of a chromosome together with its basic annotation.  This panel displays synteny blocks, cytogenetic chromosome band(s), DNA contigs, markers, and genes.<br><img src="/biomed505/Course/IntroSeqAnalysis/images/overview.png" border="0" alt="Ensembl ContigViewOverview"></a><br>
        <dt>Detailed View Panel
        <dd>The Detailed View shows small regions of chromosomes and provides more detailed information on genome sequence annotation.<br><img src="/biomed505/Course/IntroSeqAnalysis/images/detailed.gif" border="0" alt="Ensembl ContigViewDetail"></a><br>
        <dt>Basepair View Panel
        <dd>This panel is used to show features on a small segment of the assembly.  The region displayed by default is 101 bp, taken from the center of the Detailed View panel.<br><img src="/biomed505/Course/IntroSeqAnalysis/images/basepair.png" border="0" alt="Ensembl ContigViewBP"></a><br>
      </dl>
      The red boxes on the assembly in the 'Chromosome', 'Overview' and 'Detailed View' panels represent the regions shown at higher magnification in the next panel below.  These can be moved by clicking anywhere on the assembly on which they are drawn.
      <p>In the Overview panel, Click on the <span class="input">AVP</span> gene.  This will re-center the views on this gene.

      These buttons above provide the option to zoom in and out, varying the size of the region displayed.  Use this to restrict or expand the field of view to a scale suitable to view any feature of interest.  Click on steps in the ramp to display 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500 kb or 1 Mb.  Clicking plus or minus zooms in or out by a factor of approximately 2, and allows zooming in to as little as 11 bp.  Regions larger than 1 Mb can only be seen in the Overview panel.  Generally, the CytoView is recommended for viewing larger segments of a chromosome.
      <p><p>In the Detailed View panel, zoom in by clicking the large <img src="/biomed505/Course/IntroSeqAnalysis/images/plus.gif" alt="plus"> button.  You should notice that the red box on the assembly in the 'Overview' section is now smaller.

        <li>Pull-down menus on the golden menu bar at the top of 'Detailed View'. Changes will take effect when they are closed by clicking at the bottom of the menu.</li>
        <li>A configuration page (accessed by clicking on 'Advanced...', the last item on both the 'Features' and the 'Decorations' pull-down menus).</li>

The BLASTView Display has three sections showing Alignment Locations vs. Karyotype, Alignment Locations vs. Query, and an Alignment Summary table.  The Alignment Summary table lists the hits.  Each alignment or HSP (high scoring pair) is shown separately.  By default, the list is sorted by ascending score, but this can be changed by selecting a different option in the "Sort By" box.  Locations are shown as positions on the genomic assembly, either chromosomes or scaffolds, depending on the species, together with the strands of the query and subject that were aligned.  For each alignment, links are provided to additional displays:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>[C]</strong> - view the hit in context in a ContigView display of the chromosome region.</li>
        <li><strong>[G]</strong> - view the hit in the context of the annotated genome sequence. Ensembl and EST exons predicted by the Ensembl analysis pipeline, manually curated Vega exons, as well as exons predicted by <em>ab initio</em> methods and SNPs are annotated on the genome sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>[S]</strong> - display the query sequence with the bases of all hit alignments marked. The location of the current alignment is shown in red, other alignments in the hit are shown in blue. Hint: Watch the mark-up change in this window as you click on different alignments for the same hit.</li>
        <li><strong>[A]</strong> - display the alignment for the selected HSP.</li>
