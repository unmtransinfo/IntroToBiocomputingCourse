<P>"Biff was Heidi Stettner's dog, back when Heidi (and I
and <A HREF="bill.html">Bill Joy</A>) were all grad students at U.C.Berkley and
the early versions of BSD were being developed. Biff was
popular among the residents of Evans Hall, and was known
for barking at the mailman, hence the name of the
command."</P>
