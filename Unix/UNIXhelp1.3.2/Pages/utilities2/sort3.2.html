<H1>Defining the sort field</H1>

<P>The first field of each line starts at 0 (zero); the
second is 1 (one) and so on.</P>

<P>To define which field to sort on you give the position
of the field at which to start the sort followed by the
position at which to end the sort.</P>

<P>The position at which to start the sort is given as the
number of fields to skip to get to this position. For example</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>+2</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>tells <STRONG>sort</STRONG> to skip the first two fields.</P>

<P>The position at which to stop the sort is given as the
number of the field at the end of which the sort stops.
For example</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>-3</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>tells <STRONG>sort</STRONG> to stop the sort at the end of field three.</P>

<P>To sort on the third field of a line use the definition:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>+2 -3</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>To sort on the fields 5 and 6:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>+4 -6</STRONG>
</PRE>
