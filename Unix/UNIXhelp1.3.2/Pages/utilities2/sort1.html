<HR>

<P>To sort a file on field2 (the third word):</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>sort +2 -3 names</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This sorts the file <SAMP>names</SAMP> on the third word of
each line.</P>

<HR>

<P>To sort several files using a different sort
order and send the results to another file:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>sort -n -o report +1 -2 month[1-3]</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This sorts the files <SAMP>month1</SAMP> through <SAMP>month3</SAMP>
on field1 (the
second word) according to their numeric value and places
the result in the file <SAMP>report</SAMP>.</P>

<HR>

<P>To sort a file on a specific part of one field, using
a different field delimiter, removing duplicate lines and
sending the output to another file:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>sort -t: -o birthdays +3.2 -4.5 friends</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This sorts the file <SAMP>friends</SAMP> on the third and fourth
characters of field3 (fourth word). Each field in this
file is delimited by a <STRONG>:</STRONG> (colon). The results are
placed in the file <SAMP>birthdays</SAMP>.</P>
