<H1>Sorting on a specific part of a field</H1>

<P>You can also sort on a specific part of a field if necessary.</P>

<P>To define which part of a field to sort on you give the position
in the field at which to start the sort followed by the
position in the field at which to end the sort.</P>

<P>The position at which to start the sort is given as the number
of fields to skip followed by the number of characters to
skip. For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>+2.3</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>tells <STRONG>sort</STRONG> to skip the first two fields and the
first three characters of field 3.</P>

<P>The position at which to stop the sort is given as the
number of the field followed by number of the character
in that field at which the sort is to stop.  For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>-3.6</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>tells <STRONG>sort</STRONG> to stop the sort at the 6th character
in field three.</P>

<P>To sort on the fourth and fifth characters of field three:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>+2.3  -3.6</STRONG>
</PRE>
