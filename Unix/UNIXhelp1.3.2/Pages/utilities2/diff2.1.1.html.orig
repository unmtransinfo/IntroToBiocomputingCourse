</PRE>

<P><STRONG>diff</STRONG> reports that the file (or directory) 
<SAMP>schedule</SAMP>is unique to the directory <SAMP>Usability</SAMP>.</P>

<P><STRONG>diff</STRONG> then reports that there are differences between the
file <SAMP>email</SAMP> in the directory <SAMP>usability</SAMP> and the file
of the same name in the directory <SAMP>Usability</SAMP>.</P>

<P>To make these files match you need to add (<SAMP>a</SAMP>) lines
3 and 4 (<SAMP>3,4</SAMP>) of the file <SAMP>Usability/email</SAMP>
(<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>) after line 2 in the file <SAMP>usability/email</SAMP>.</P>
