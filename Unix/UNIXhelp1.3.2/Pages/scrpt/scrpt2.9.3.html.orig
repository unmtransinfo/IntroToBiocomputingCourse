<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<H1>Examples of interrupt handling</H1>

<P>To use single quotes to inhibit command substitution:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   #!/bin/sh
   trap 'echo `pwd` &gt;&gt;$HOME/errdir' 2 3 15
   for i in /bin /usr/bin /usr/any/bin
   do
   cd $i
   some series of commands in the directory $i
   done
</PRE>

<P>The file <SAMP>errdir</SAMP> will contain the name of the directory
being worked on when the procedure is interrupted. What
happens if the same procedure has double quotes around
it?</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   trap "echo `pwd` &gt;errdir" 2 3 15 
</PRE>

<P>The file <SAMP>errdir</SAMP> will just contain the name of the
directory from which the procedure was invoked because
the <STRONG>pwd</STRONG> command would be substituted on the first scan by
the shell and not when it is invoked in the script.</P>

<HR>

<P>To remove temporary files when a procedure is interrupted:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   #!/bin/sh
   temp=/tmp/file.$$
   trap 'rm $temp; exit' 0 1 2 3 15
   ls &gt; $temp
   .....  
</PRE>

<P>If any of the named signals are encountered, the command
<SAMP>rm $temp; exit</SAMP> will be executed.  The 
<STRONG>exit</STRONG> command
is needed to terminate the execution of the whole procedure.</P>

<HR>

<P>To continue processing commands after a <STRONG>trap</STRONG>
command:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   #!/bin/sh
   # read and process commands
   dir=`pwd`
   for i in *
   do
     if test -d $dir/$i
     then
       cd $dir/$i
       while echo ''$i:''
       trap exit 2   # trap ^C
       read x
       do
         trap ' ' 2      # ignore interrupts
         eval $x
       done
     fi
   done
</PRE>

<P>The shell continues to process commands after a trap
command.  The entire procedure is terminated if
interrupted when waiting for input, but the interrupt
is ignored while executing a command. The 
<A HREF="scrpt2.9.2.html">command list</A>
is an explicitly quoted null command and so the signal
is ignored by the shell.</P>
