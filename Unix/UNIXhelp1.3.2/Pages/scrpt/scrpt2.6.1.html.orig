<H1>The <SAMP>case</SAMP> statement</H1>

<P><SAMP>case</SAMP> is a flow control construct that provides for
multi-way branching based on patterns.</P>

<P>Program flow is controlled on the basis of the <EM>word</EM>given.  This 
<EM>word</EM> is compared with each <EM>pattern</EM> in
order until a match is found, at which point the
associated <EM>command</EM>(<EM>s</EM>) are executed.</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   case <EM>word</EM> in
   <EM>pattern1</EM>) <EM>command(s)</EM>
   ;;
   <EM>pattern2</EM>) <EM>command(s)</EM>
   ;;
   <EM>patternN</EM>) <EM>command(s)</EM>
   ;;
   esac
</PRE>

<P>When all the commands are executed control is passed to
the first statement after the <SAMP>esac</SAMP>.  Each list of
commands must end with a double semi-colon (<SAMP>;;</SAMP>).</P>

<P>A command can be associated with more than one pattern.
Patterns can be separated from each other by a <SAMP>|</SAMP> symbol.
For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   case <EM>word</EM> in
   <EM>pattern1|pattern2</EM>) <EM>command</EM>
   ...					;;
</PRE>

<P>Patterns are checked for a match in the order in which
they appear. A command is always carried out after the
first instance of a pattern.</P>

<P>The <SAMP>*</SAMP> character can be used to specify a default pattern
as the <SAMP>*</SAMP> character is the shell 
<A HREF="../concepts/regexp1.html">wildcard</A> character.</P>
