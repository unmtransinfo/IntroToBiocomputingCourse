<H1>Example of a simple shell script</H1>

<P>These are the contents of a shell script called <STRONG>display</STRONG>:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>cat display</STRONG>
   # This script displays the date, time, username and
   # current directory.
   echo "Date and time is:"
   date
   echo
   echo "Your username is: `whoami` \n"
   echo "Your current directory is: \c"
   pwd
</PRE>

<P>The first two lines beginning with a hash (<SAMP>#</SAMP>) are comments
and are not interpreted by the shell.  Use comments to
document your shell script; you will be surprised how
easy it is to forget what your own programs do!</P>

<P>The backquotes (<SAMP>`</SAMP>) around the command 
<STRONG><A HREF="../didyou/username.html">whoami</A></STRONG>
illustrate the use of 
<A HREF="../commanz/cmd_sub.html">command substitution</A>.</P>

<P>The <SAMP>\n</SAMP> is an option of the echo command that tells the
shell to add an extra carriage return at the end of the
line.  The <SAMP>\c</SAMP> tells the shell to stay on the same line.
See the 
<A HREF="http://biocomp.health.unm.edu/biomed505/Unix/UNIXhelp1.3.2/Scripts/man-cgi?echo">man page</A>
for details of other options.</P>

<P>The argument to the echo command is <A HREF="../commanz/cmd2.2.html">quoted</A>
to prevent the shell interpreting these commands as though they had
been escaped with the <SAMP>\</SAMP> (backslash) character.</P>
