<H1>The <SAMP>while</SAMP> and <SAMP>until</SAMP> statements</H1>

<P>The <SAMP>while</SAMP> statement has the general form:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   while <EM>command-list1</EM>
   do
     <EM>command-list2</EM>
   done 
</PRE>

<P>The commands in <EM>command-list1</EM> are executed; and if the
exit status of the last command in that list is 0 (zero),
the commands in <EM>command-list2</EM> are executed.</P>

<P>The sequence is repeated as long as the exit status of
<EM>command-list1</EM> is 0 (zero).</P>

<P>The <SAMP>until</SAMP> statement has the general form:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   until <EM>command-list1</EM>
   do
     <EM>command-list2</EM>
   done
</PRE>

<P>This is identical in function to the <SAMP>while</SAMP> command except
that the loop is executed as long as the exit status of
<EM>command-list1</EM> is non-zero.</P>

<P>The exit status of a <SAMP>while/until</SAMP> command is the exit
status of the last command executed in <EM>command-list2</EM>.  If
no such command list is executed, a <SAMP>while/until</SAMP> has an exit
status of 0 (zero).</P>
