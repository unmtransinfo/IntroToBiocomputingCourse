<H1>Special shell variables</H1>

<P>There are some variables which are set internally by the
shell and which are available to the user:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>

<STRONG>Name          Description</STRONG>
<HR>
$1 - $9       these variables are the <A HREF="scrpt2.1.html">positional parameters</A>.

$0            the name of the command currently being executed.

$#            the number of positional arguments given to this
              invocation of the shell.

$?            the exit status of the last command executed is
              given as a decimal string.  When a command
              completes successfully, it returns the exit status
              of 0 (zero), otherwise it returns a non-zero exit
              status.

$$            the process number of this shell - useful for
              including in filenames, to make them unique.

$!            the process id of the last command run in
              the background.

$-            the current options supplied to this invocation
              of the shell.

$*            a string containing all the arguments to the
              shell, starting at $1.

$@            same as above, except when quoted.

<HR></PRE>

<H3>Notes</H3>

<P><SAMP>$*</SAMP> and <SAMP>$@</SAMP> when unquoted are identical and expand into the
arguments.</P>

<P><SAMP>"$*"</SAMP> is a single word, comprising all the arguments to the
shell, joined together with spaces.  For example <SAMP>'1 2' 3</SAMP>
becomes <SAMP>"1 2 3"</SAMP>.</P>

<P><SAMP>"$@"</SAMP> is identical to the arguments received by the shell, the
resulting list of words completely match what was given
to the shell.  For example <SAMP>'1 2' 3</SAMP> becomes <SAMP>"1 2" "3"</SAMP></P>
