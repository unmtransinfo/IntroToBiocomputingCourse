<H1>More on environment variables in <SAMP>csh/tcsh</SAMP></H1>

<P>This complicated procedure is designed to allow the the
login shell to be set up to behave differently to
subsequent shells.  And since environment variables only
need to be initialised once at login, the behaviour of
other shells can be changed by setting shell variables
in <SAMP>.cshrc</SAMP> which is read each time a new shell is invoked.</P>

<P>Usually, you are are advised to set environment
variables  in your <SAMP>.login</SAMP> file and shell variables in
your <SAMP>.cshrc</SAMP>. This arrangement prevents your environment
being re-initialised every time a shell is started.</P>

<P>If you use a network windowing systems such as X, it is
likely that you may start up a shell on a remote host
which is not a login shell.  If this is the case, any
environment variables set in your <SAMP>.login</SAMP> on that host
will not become part of your environment.</P>

<P>Puzzled? Don't be.  The simplest solution is to set <EM>both</EM>
environment <EM>and</EM> shell variables in your <SAMP>.cshrc</SAMP>
or (<SAMP>.tcshrc</SAMP>) file.</P>
