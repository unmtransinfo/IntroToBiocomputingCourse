<h2><a name="deleting">deleting text</a></h2>

<PRE WIDTH=80>
Everything deleted can be stored into a buffer. This is achieved by
putting a `"' and a letter &lt;a-z&gt; before the delete command. The
deleted text will be in the buffer with the used letter. If &lt;A-Z&gt;
is used as buffer name, the conjugate buffer &lt;a-z&gt; will be augmented
instead of overwritten with the text. The undo buffer always
contains the latest change. Buffers &lt;1-9&gt; contain the latest 9
LINE deletions (`"1' is most recent).

 * | x                  | Delete &lt;*&gt; chars under and after the cursor.
 * | X                  | &lt;*&gt; chars before the cursor.
 * | d&lt;move&gt;            | From begin to endpoint of &lt;*&gt;&lt;move&gt;.
 * | dd                 | &lt;*&gt; lines.

                        |   `ai' set too.
 - | ~                  | Switch lower and upper cases
                        |   (should be an operator, like `c').

                        |   flags &lt;f&gt; are `g' for `global' (i.e. change
                        |   every non-overlapping occurrence of &lt;p&gt;) and
                        |   `c' for `confirm' (type `y' to confirm a
                        |   particular substitution, else &lt;cr&gt;).  Instead
                        |   of `/' any punctuation CHAR unequal to &lt;lf&gt;
                        |   can be used as delimiter.
</pre>

<h2><a name="substitute">substitute replacement patterns</a></h2>

<PRE WIDTH=80>
The basic meta-characters for the replacement pattern are `&amp;' and `~';
these are given as `\&amp;' and `\~' when nomagic is set.  Each instance
of `&amp;' is replaced by the characters which the regular expression
matched.  The meta-character `~' stands, in the replacement
pattern, for the defining text of the previous replacement
pattern.  Other meta-sequences possible in the replacement pattern
are always introduced by the escaping character `\'.  The sequence
`\n' (with `n' in [1-9]) is replaced by the text matched by the
n-th regular subexpression enclosed between `\(' and `\)'.  The
sequences `\u' and `\l' cause the immediately following character
in the replacement to be converted to upper- or lower-case
respectively if this character is a letter.  The sequences `\U' and
`\L' turn such conversion on, either until `\E' or `\e' is
encountered, or until the end of the replacement pattern.
</pre>

<h2><a name="remembering">remembering text (yanking)</a></h2>

<PRE WIDTH=80>
With yank commands you can put `"&lt;a-zA-Z&gt;' before the command, just as
with delete commands.  Otherwise you only copy to the undo buffer.
The use of buffers &lt;a-z&gt; is THE way of copying text to another file;
see the `:e &lt;file&gt;' command.

* | y&lt;move&gt;            | Yank from begin to endpoint of &lt;*&gt;&lt;move&gt;.
 * | yy                 | &lt;*&gt; lines.
 * | Y                  | Idem (should be equivalent to `y$' though).
 - | m&lt;a-z&gt;             | Mark the cursor position with a letter.

<h2><a name="appcommands">commands while in append|change mode</a></h2>

^@                      | If typed as the first character of the

<h2><a name="writing">writing, editing other files, and quitting vi</a></h2>

<PRE WIDTH=80>
In `:' `ex' commands - if not the first CHAR on the line - `%' denotes
the current file, `#' is a synonym for the alternate file (which
normally is the previous file).  As first CHAR on the line `%' is a
shorthand for `1,$'.  Marks can be used for line numbers too: '&lt;a-z&gt;.
In the `:w'|`:f'|`:cd'|`:e'|`:n' commands shell meta-characters can be
used.

:q                      | Quit vi, unless the buffer has been changed.

<PRE WIDTH=80>
When mapping take a look at the options `to' and `remap' (below).

:map &lt;string&gt; &lt;seq&gt;     | &lt;string&gt; is interpreted as &lt;seq&gt;, e.g.
                        |   `:map ^C :!cc %^V&lt;cr&gt;' to invoke `cc' (the C
                        |   compiler) from within the editor
                        |   (vi replaces `%' with the current file name).
:map                    | Show all mappings.
:unmap &lt;string&gt;         | Deprive &lt;string&gt; of its mapping.  When vi
                        |   complains about non-mapped macros (whereas no
                        |   typos have been made), first do something like
                        |   `:map &lt;string&gt; Z', followed by
                        |   `:unmap &lt;string&gt;' (`Z' must not be a macro
                        |   itself), or switch to `ex' mode first with `Q'.
:map! &lt;string&gt; &lt;seq&gt;    | Mapping in append mode, e.g.
                        |   `:map! \be begin^V&lt;cr&gt;end;^V&lt;esc&gt;O&lt;ht&gt;'.
                        |   When in append mode &lt;string&gt; is preceded by
                        |   `^V', no mapping is done.
:map!                   | Show all append mode mappings.
:unmap! &lt;string&gt;        | Deprive &lt;string&gt; of its mapping (see `:unmap').
:ab &lt;string&gt; &lt;seq&gt;      | Whenever in append mode &lt;string&gt; is preceded and
                        |   followed by a breakpoint (e.g. &lt;sp&gt; or `,'), it
                        |   is interpreted as &lt;seq&gt;, e.g.
                        |   `:ab ^P procedure'.  A `^V' immediately
                        |   following &lt;string&gt; inhibits expansion.
:ab                     | Show all abbreviations.
:unab &lt;string&gt;          | Do not consider &lt;string&gt; an abbreviation
                        |   anymore (see `:unmap').

vi [&lt;files&gt;]            | Edit the files, start with the first page of
                        |   the first file.

The editor can be initialized by the shell variable `EXINIT', which
looks like:

        EXINIT='&lt;cmd&gt;|&lt;cmd&gt;|...'
        &lt;cmd&gt;: set options
               map ...
               ab ...
        export EXINIT (in the Bourne shell)

However, the list of initializations can also be put into a file.
If this file is located in your home directory, and is named `.exrc'
AND the variable `EXINIT' is NOT set, the list will be executed
automatically at startup time. However, vi will always execute the
contents of a `.exrc' in the current directory, if you own the file.
Else you have to give the execute (`source') command yourself:

        :so file

In a `.exrc' file a comment is introduced with a double quote character:
the rest of the line is ignored.  Exception: if the last command on the
line is a `map[!]' or `ab' command or a shell escape, a trailing comment
is not recognized, but considered part of the command.

On-line initializations can be given with `vi +&lt;cmd&gt; file', e.g.:

vi +x file              | The cursor will immediately jump to line x
                        |   (default last line).
vi +/&lt;string&gt; file      | Jump to the first occurrence of &lt;string&gt;.

You can start at a particular tag with:

vi -t &lt;tag&gt;             | Start in the right file in the right place.

<a name="vi-r">Sometimes (e.g. if the system crashed while you were editing) it is</a>
possible to recover files lost in the editor by `vi -r file'.  A plain
`vi -r' command shows the files you can recover.
If you just want to view a file by using vi, and you want to avoid any
change, instead of vi you can use the `view' or `vi -R' command:
the option `readonly' will be set automatically (with `:w!' you can
override this option).

                        |   `.bp' as paragraph delimiters.  Empty lines and
                        |   section boundaries are paragraph boundaries

                        |   expanded until they are unchanged.
                        |   Example: if `o' is mapped to `A', and `A'
                        |   is mapped to `I', then `o' will map to `I'
                        |   if `remap' is set, else it will map to `A'.
report=&lt;*&gt;              | Vi reports whenever e.g. a delete

                        |   will beep.

                        |   typed fast enough.

                        |   within &lt;wm&gt; columns from the right margin
                        |   (0 = don't put a &lt;lf&gt; in the file, yet put it
                        |   on the screen).
