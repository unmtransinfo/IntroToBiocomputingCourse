<H1>Network domains and mail addresses</H1>

<P>Large networks may have thousands of systems connected to
them.  A domain name addressing scheme is used to specify
system addresses in a way that humans can understand.</P>

<P>The top level domain for the UK is <SAMP>uk</SAMP>. This domain
has several sub-domains: <SAMP>ac</SAMP> (for academic) and <SAMP>co</SAMP>
(for commercial).</P>

<P>The <SAMP>ac</SAMP> domain has many sub-domains, based on the name of
the organisations within it.  The sub-domain for the
University of Hull for example is <SAMP>hull</SAMP>.</P>

<P>If the organisation has a large number of systems, then
the organisational domain might also contain sub-domains,
each of which contains a number of systems. This is often
done on a departmental or service basis.</P>

<P>The mail address for any system can be given as a series of
domains, each of which is separated by a dot (full stop).</P>

<P>For example, the full mail address to a user on a particular
system might look like this:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   john@ubik.ucs.ed.ac.uk
</PRE>

<P>Reading from left to right, this is the mail address for
the user known as <SAMP>john</SAMP> on the system called 
<SAMP>ubik</SAMP>. This system is in the organisational sub-domain 
<SAMP>ucs</SAMP>,
(University Computing Service) which is in the organisational
domain <SAMP>ed</SAMP> (Edinburgh).</P>

<P>This organisation is located in the <SAMP>ac</SAMP> (academic domain)
for the national domain <SAMP>uk</SAMP> (United Kingdom).</P>
