<H1>Finding a person's mail address</H1>

<P>Electronic mail programs do not provide you with the
equivalent to a telephone directory: there is no way that
you can <A HREF="three.4.html">look up a person's</A>
electronic mail address.</P>

<P>Many people now include their email address on their
business stationery. And of course you can always ask
them for it.</P>

<P>The "header" of any mail that you receive will contain
the email address of the person who sent it, in the 
<SAMP>From:</SAMP>field. For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   Date:     Tue, 18 Aug 92 12:15:17 WET DST
   From:     <STRONG>tony@bigfish.com</STRONG>
   Subject:  Xgator troubles
   To:       john@castle.ed.ac.uk
</PRE>

<P>Each domain has a "postmaster" who will try to supply you
with a mail address if asked. For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   From:     john@ed.ac.uk
   Subject:  Address please
   To:       <STRONG>postmaster@durham</STRONG>
   Please provide the email address for Dr J.R.
   Dozer who is a member of staff in the Psychology
   Dept.
   Thankyou
</PRE>
