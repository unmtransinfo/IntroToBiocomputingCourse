<P><SAMP>pine</SAMP> is a mail program developed at the University of
Washington. It has easy-to-remember single character commands and a menu
interface which displays those available at each point.</P>

<P>You might choose to use pine if you like learning new tools by
exploration rather than reading a manual. The menu system is designed to
handle mistakes by new users, and the on-line help system offers advice
specific to whatever screen you are currently viewing.</P>

<P>Start using <SAMP>pine</SAMP> with the command:</P>

more than one mailbox to manage your electronic mail.</P>
