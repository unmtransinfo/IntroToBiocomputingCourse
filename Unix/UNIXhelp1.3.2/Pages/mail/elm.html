<P><SAMP>elm</SAMP> was initially developed to provide a full-screen
mail program when only simple line-based ones were available. Since then
it has grown and become established among the Unix community. Unlike
<SAMP>mail</SAMP> which works mostly with one line at a time,
<SAMP>elm</SAMP> takes advantage of the entire terminal screen for
listing mail received and editing messages.</P>

<SAMP>elm</SAMP> and is more sophisticated.</P>
