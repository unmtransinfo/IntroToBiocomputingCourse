<H2><A NAME="boot">boot</A></H2>

<DL>
<DD><P>this term derives from `bootstrap loader', a short
program that was read in from cards or paper tape, or
toggled in from the front panel switches.  This program
was always very short (great efforts were expended on
making it short in order to minimise the labour and chance
of error involved in toggling it in), but was just smart
enough to read in a slightly more complex program
(usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it
handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to
read the application or operating system from a magnetic
tape drive or disk drive.  Thus, in successive steps, the
computer `pulled itself up by its bootstraps' to a useful
operating state.</P></DD>
