<P>When a command is carried out successfully, the results
are sent to the standard output file. But if the command
fails to execute successfully the results are displayed
on the standard error file -your terminal. For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>ls -l part1.txt</STRONG>
   part1.txt not found
</PRE>

<P>The <STRONG>ls</STRONG> command fails because the file 
<SAMP>part1.txt</SAMP> does not
exist in the current directory. A message is sent to the
standard error - your terminal - informing you of this.</P>

<P>You can redirect the standard error away from your
terminal to another file but this is generally
discouraged.  The method for doing this also varies
slightly with different shells.  Consult the manual page
for the shell that you are using for further details.</P>
