<P>Unix commands are executable binary files located in
directories with the name <SAMP>bin</SAMP> (for binary). Many of the
commands that you use are located in the directory
 <SAMP>/usr/bin</SAMP>.</P>

<P>When you enter the name of a command the
 <A HREF="../shell/index.html">shell</A> checks to see if it is a 
 <A HREF="../shell/fork.html">built-in</A> command.  If it is not,
it looks for the the binary file that the command name
refers to in each of the directories that are defined in
the <SAMP>PATH</SAMP> <A HREF="../glossary/ge.html#envirovar">environment
variable</A>.
