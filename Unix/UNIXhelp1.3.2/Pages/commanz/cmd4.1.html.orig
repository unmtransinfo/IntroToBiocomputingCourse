<H1>Examples of using pipelines to connect commands</H1>

<P>To pipe the output from one command into another
command:</P>

<PRE>   <STRONG>who | wc -l</STRONG>
   342
</PRE>

<P>This command tells you how many users are currently logged
in on the system: a lot!</P>

<P>The standard output from the <STRONG>who</STRONG> command - a list
of all the users currently logged in on the system - is piped into
the <STRONG>wc</STRONG> command as its standard input.  Used with the 
 <SAMP>-l</SAMP> option this command counts the numbers of lines in the
standard input and displays the result on the standard
output.</P>

<HR>

<P>To connect several commands together:</P>

<PRE>   <STRONG>ps -aux|grep joe|sort +5 -6|less</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>The first command <SAMP>ps -aux</SAMP> outputs information about the
processes currently running. This information becomes the
input to the command <SAMP>grep joe</SAMP> which searches for any
lines that contain the username "joe". The output from
this command is then sorted on the sixth field of each
line, with the output being displayed one screenful at a
time using the <SAMP>less</SAMP> pager.</P>
