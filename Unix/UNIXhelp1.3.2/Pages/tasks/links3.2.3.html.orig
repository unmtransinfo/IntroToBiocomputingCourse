<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<H1>Removing linked directories that contain links</H1>

<P>What happens if you <A HREF="links3.2.2.html">remove a directory that is a symbolic
link to another directory</A> and in which you have created
links to other files and/or directories?</P>

<P>Remember that the directory is just a linkname pointing to
the "real" directory; so it is in this directory that the
linknames of files and/or directories exist.</P>

<P>When you remove this type of directory, all that happens
is that the linkname of the directory is removed.  Any
links you have made to the directory remain in the
directory that this linkname pointed to.</P>

<P>Look at this example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>pwd</STRONG>
       <EM>(print the user's working directory)</EM>
   /home/tom/reports
   <STRONG>ls ../tmp/drafts</STRONG>
       <EM>(list the contents of this directory)</EM>
   expenditure targets
   <STRONG>ln -s $HOME/tmp/drafts quarterly</STRONG>
       <EM>(use a symbolic link to make the directory)</EM>
   <STRONG>cd quarterly</STRONG>
       <EM>(change directory to this linkname)</EM>
   <STRONG>ln $HOME/accounts/expenses</STRONG>
       <EM>(link a file to this linkname)</EM>
   <STRONG>ls</STRONG>
       <EM>(list the contents of the linked directory)</EM>
       <EM>(the linked file is listed)</EM>
   expenditure expenses targets
   <STRONG>cd ..; rm quarterly</STRONG>
       <EM>(go to the parent directory and remove the linkname)</EM>
   <STRONG>ls ../tmp/drafts</STRONG>
       <EM>(list the directory the linkname pointed to)</EM>
   expenditure expenses targets
       <EM>(the linked file is still there)</EM>
</PRE>
