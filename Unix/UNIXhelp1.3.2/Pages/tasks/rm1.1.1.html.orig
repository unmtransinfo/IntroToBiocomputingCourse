<H1>Examples of removing files with the <SAMP>rm</SAMP> command</H1>

<P>To remove a single file:

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>rm help.txt</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This removes the file <SAMP>help.txt</SAMP> from the current
directory.</P>

<HR>

<P>To remove several files:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>rm artwork/figure[2-7]</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This removes files <SAMP>figure2</SAMP> through to <SAMP>figure7</SAMP>
from the subdirectory <SAMP>artwork</SAMP>.</P>

<HR>

<P>To remove a file which you don't have write
permission for:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>rm tmp/intro.txt</STRONG>
   rm: override protection 444 for intro.txt? <STRONG>y</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This removes the file <SAMP>intro.txt</SAMP> from the
subdirectory <SAMP>tmp</SAMP>. Because you don't have write
permission for this file you are asked to confirm that
you want to remove it. Entering a <STRONG>y</STRONG> removes the file
provided you own the directory <SAMP>tmp</SAMP>,
any other response leaves the file alone.</P>

<HR>

<P>To remove files interactively:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>rm -i *.fm</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This will prompt you to confirm that you want to remove a
file from the current directory whenever that file has the
suffix <SAMP>.fm</SAMP>.</P>

<P>Answering <STRONG>y</STRONG> will delete the file. The file is not
deleted if any other response is given.</P>
