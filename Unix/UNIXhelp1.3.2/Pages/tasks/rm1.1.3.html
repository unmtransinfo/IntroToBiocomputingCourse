<H1>Removing files that have links</H1>

<P>Remove a file that has hard links to it the same way as
you would remove any other file:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>rm <EM>filename(s)</EM></STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>Any files that were created by making hard links to the
<SAMP>filename</SAMP> will continue to exist in their own right.</P>

<P>Removing a file to which symbolic links have been made
has a different effect. Although the linkname remains,
the actual file that this name points to does not.</P>

<P>Trying to use a command on the linkname will give you the
message:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <EM>command</EM>: <EM>filename</EM>: No such file or directory
</PRE>
