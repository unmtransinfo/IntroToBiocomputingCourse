<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<H1>Understanding the location of linked directories</H1>

<P>There is a subtle difference between a "normal" directory
and a directory created with a symbolic link to another
directory.</P>

<P>What happens if you do a <STRONG>cd</STRONG> (change directory) to
this type of directory? You are placed in the directory
that the symbolic link points to.</P>

<P>This can be confusing, especially if you have changed
your <A HREF="../environment/env8.html">shell prompt</A>
so that it displays the current working directory.</P>

<P>Look at this example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>pwd</STRONG>
       <EM>(print the user's working directory)</EM>
   /usr/home/john/tmp
   <STRONG>ln -s $HOME/accounts/may fifth</STRONG>
       <EM>(use a symbolic link named fifth that points to</EM>
       <EM> the directory $HOME/accounts/may)</EM>
   <STRONG>ls</STRONG>
   fifth
   <STRONG>cd fifth</STRONG>
       <EM>(change directory to the new directory)</EM>
   <STRONG>pwd</STRONG>
       <EM>(print the working directory)</EM>
   /usr/home/john/accounts/may
       <EM>(the user is actually in the the directory that the</EM>
       <EM> linked directory points to)</EM>
</PRE>

<P>When the user does a <STRONG>cd</STRONG> (change directory) to the
symbolically linked directory <SAMP>may</SAMP> in their current
working directory, they change to the directory that this
link points to, the directory 
<SAMP>/usr/home/john/accounts/may</SAMP>.</P>
