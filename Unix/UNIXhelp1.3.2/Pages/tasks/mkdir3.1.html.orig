<H1>Using the <SAMP>/tmp</SAMP> directory</H1>

<P>Each Unix system has a directory <SAMP>/tmp</SAMP> which acts as a
"scratch area" which you can use to hold files and
directories for short periods of time. For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   <STRONG>mkdir /tmp/for_u_tim</STRONG>
   <STRONG>cp -r surprise /tmp/for_u_tim</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>This creates the directory <SAMP>for_u_tim</SAMP> in the directory
<SAMP>/tmp</SAMP> and then copies the directory <SAMP>surprise</SAMP>
to it.</P>

<P>User <SAMP>tim</SAMP> might have been told that there is "something"
for them in <SAMP>/tmp</SAMP>.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="access_permissions.html">access permissions</A>
and the <A HREF="change_own.html">group ownership</A> must be
set correctly before another user can copy the directory
or link to it.</P>

<P>Remember to remove files and directories that you copy to
or create in the directory <SAMP>/tmp</SAMP>; other people need
that space too.</P>

<P><EM>Do not</EM> use the <SAMP>/tmp</SAMP> directory to store vital
information; it is cleared whenever the system is "booted
up" and by the system administrator when the directory gets
full.</P>
