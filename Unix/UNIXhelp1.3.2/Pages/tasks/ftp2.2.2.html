<H1>Understanding host names</H1>

<P>Each host has a unique address, which is given as a dot
separated list of named domains. For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   ftp.ucs.ed.ac.uk
</PRE>

<P>This is the "domain name" of the host which acts as the
anonymous ftp server (ftp) for the university computing
services (ucs) at Edinburgh (ed).  As a university it
resides in the academic (ac) domain for the United
Kingdom (uk).</P>

<P>You might not need to give the full address. In the above
example, someone at another UK academic site only needs
to use the <SAMP>ftp.ucs.ed</SAMP> part of the name.  They can assume
that their local host is in the same (academic) domain as
this host.</P>

<P>Names can also be given as a series of dot (.) separated
numbers. For example</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   129.148.31.66
</PRE>

<P>can be used instead of</P>

<PRE WIDTH=80>   wilma.cs.brown.edu
   (66) (31)(148)(129)
</PRE>

<P>Each number is the identifier for a particular domain.
However, unlike domain names, the left-most number
is the most significant, and represents the top domain.</P>
