<H1>Using MicroEMACS commands</H1>

<P>You can type MicroEMACS instructions in upper or lower
case. There are two types of instruction, CONTROL and
META.</P>

<H3>CONTROL instructions</H3>

<P>These are typed while holding down the CTRL key
which is signified by the ^ character.  For example
^F is generated by pressing the F key while holding
down the CTRL key.</P>

<H3>META instructions</H3>

<P>These are typed after pressing the ESC key which is
signified by M-.  For example, M-F is generated by
pressing the ESC key and then typing the letter F.
Throughout this document, the ESC key is referred to
as the META key.</P>

<P>Remember, the CONTROL instructions are typed with
the CTRL key and the META instructions are typed
after the ESC key.</P>

<P>Sometimes a META or CONTROL instruction will prompt
you for more information.  This information may be
another META or CONTROL instruction or some text.</P>
