<H1>Home Directory</H1>

<P>Any UNIX system can have many users on it at any one
time. As a user you are given a home directory in which
you are placed whenever you <A HREF="../basics/basic1.html">log on</A>
 to the system.</P>

<P>User's home directories are usually grouped together
under a system directory such as <SAMP>/home</SAMP>.
A large UNIX system may have several hundred users, with their
home directories grouped in subdirectories according to some
schema such as their organisational department.</P>
