<H1>History of the UNIX operating system</H1>

<P>The first version of UNIX was created in 1969 by Kenneth Thompson and
Dennis Ritchie, system engineers at AT&T's Bell Labs. It went through
many revisions and gained in popularity until 1977, when it was first
made commercially available by Interactive Systems Corporation.</P>

<P>At the same time a team from the University of California at Berkeley
was working to improve UNIX. In 1977 it released the first Berkeley
Software Distribution, which became known as <STRONG>BSD</STRONG>. Over
time this won favour through innovations such as the
<A HREF="../shell/oview2.2.html">C shell</A>.</P>

<P>Meanwhile the AT&T version was developing in different ways. The 1978
release of Version 7 included the <A HREF="../shell/oview2.1.html">Bourne
Shell</A> for the first time. By 1983 commercial interest was growing
and Sun Microsystems produced a UNIX workstation. <STRONG>System
V</STRONG> appeared, directly descended from the original AT&T UNIX and
the prototype of the more widely used variant today.</P>
